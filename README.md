# Superheros
*****
### Author : Mugo Joseph Wamiti

## Project Description
This project is focused on building a simple API using Rails for tracking heroes and their superpowers. The aim of this project is to build a functioning API that conforms to specific guidelines, including having at least three resources, creating relationships between the resources, and adding validations to the HeroPower and Power models. To achieve this, the project requires thorough planning, including deciding on models and relationships, as well as laying out the information on the page. The project should be regularly committed to a private GitHub repository, with the TM added as a contributor for grading purposes. The end result should be a functional API that allows for the tracking of heroes and their superpowers, with appropriate validations and relationships established.

Good afternoon
 We are Optica. Our team has been working on a problem faced by Optica.
 So Optica as company has a curated collection of eyewear that is available in several styles and colors.
 However the company faces a challenge in viewing all available frames and sunglasses based on the design selected.

 The challenge reduces efficiency and wastes a significant amount of time for both the customers and staff.

 My team and I came up with a web application to help with.
