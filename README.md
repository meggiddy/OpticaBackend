Good afternoon
 We are Optica. Our team has been working on a problem faced by Optica.
 So Optica as company has a curated collection of eyewear that is available in several styles and colors.
 However the company faces a challenge in viewing all available frames and sunglasses based on the design selected.

 The challenge reduces efficiency and wastes a significant amount of time for both the customers and staff.

 My team and I came up with a web application to help with.
